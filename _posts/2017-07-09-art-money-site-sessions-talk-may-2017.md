# Art & Money - Site Sessions Talk - May 2017

This is a write up of a short talk I gave in May 2017 as part of Leila Johnston's [Site Sessions events](http://www.sitegallery.org/site-sessions-new-economies/). This is what I wanted to say but not sure if I actually did or not (until the video surfaces that is). ********************** ![](/uploads/2017/07/Slide1-768x432.png) 

Hello. My name is Aden and the title of my talk is not ‘make art note’ but I was in Amsterdam last week and this old warehouse was outside my hotel and it seemed fitting. My talk is actually called make banks open. I am going to talk to you today about banking regulation (sorry I will try and make it fun)…and hopefully how it will unleash art on the world of finance.   

![](/uploads/2017/07/Slide3-1-768x432.png) A little bit about me, I worked at HSBC for over 17 years i.e. 6258 days in total. I worked in a variety of technical roles and latterly in the innovation function (no sniggering HSBC customers) trying to make the bank better. I largely failed. But I still work in the industry but I am freelance now. I have unfinished business with banks.   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide4-768x432.png) I want to talk about 3 things in the next 10 minutes. How regulations are forcing the banks to be more open. How those changes are leading a lot of companies to believe they can solve the problems of our financial lives. And finally, thankfully a little bit about how these changes will let the art into banking, I hope.   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide6-1-768x432.png) In 2008 banks fucked the world. Over extended credit on massively complex and opaque financial instruments such a credit default swaps and mortgage backed securities brought the whole house of cards crashing down. Leading to massive government bailouts of the banks that were deemed systemically important to the worlds continued operation. This brought about mass austerity and can be blamed for a lot of societies ills today.   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide7-1-768x432.png) This crisis also fucked the banks, less so for certain but still caused them a lot of pain. Historically low interest rates rendered a lot of their old business models almost useless and they made enemies in very powerful places. The governments and the regulators. This should not have been possible and it should never happen again. A raft of huge regulatory programs were unleashed…   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide8-1-768x432.png) Now you may think this was too little too late….and you may be right but the changes that have been put in place have largely been about protecting consumers from the casino like attitudes of large banks, betting the house on fallacies. These regulations came in many shapes and size and with many weird names…two of the largest were…   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide9-1-768x432.png) Dodd-Frank a set of measures aimed at US banks (the ones that largely caused the disaster) to improve the transparency of the banks especially with regards to products like derivatives. This also introduced the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency designed to protect consumers from banks treating them unfairly…. This set of measures is currently under attack from the Tangerine Despot who hates its figure head Elizabeth Warren, the scourge of banks in the US. This is a disaster that will hopefully not come to pass.   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide10-1-768x432.png) The other large global set of measures are Basel III. These measures mean that banks have to hold a far higher percentage of actual liquid capital i.e. real money to avoid them over extending themselves again. Also a series of stress tests are undertaken at regular intervals to test the strength of banks all over the world to try and simulate similar crises to test their resilience now.   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide11-1-768x432.png) There is a new set of regulation that is coming to our shores soon. It is an EU wide piece of legislation AND I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. ….are you ready for this?   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide12-768x432.png) Boom. The Payments Service Directive 2: The revenge. Or PSD2 as it is more commonly known. It is, in my humble opinion, going to change the face of banking to a greater extent than anything I have seen in my adult lifetime (most of which has been spent working for banks).   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-06-7-768x432.png) Well my dear….let me tell you how and why it is so exciting.   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide14-768x432.png) There are a whole host of measures contained within the page turner of a document. Ultimately the ones that will impact us most are the following. This set of regulations is an attack on the middle men of payments. Predominantly the big ones. Visa, Amex and Mastercard. When was the last time you did not buy anything without using those? This will introduce measures that will open up payments. This will be achieved by the introduction of the snappily titled Payment Initiation Services and Account Information Services. New regulated entities that will be allowed to put in and take out money from your bank accounts directly in the case of the PIS. And for the AIS the ability to receive your transaction and balance data automatically in near real time. And that is very exciting because it enables a lot of very interesting things to become reality.   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide15-768x432.png) Open Banking UK – doing great work to ensure the slow bureaucracy of Europe is not hampered by inertia, or lobbying from those affected etc. This is a shift that is happening across the world. Canada, Singapore, Australia and the US are all starting their own open banking programs and the tide is not going back out…. (Since I gave this talk the API specifications have now been published <https://www.openbanking.org.uk/read-write-apis/>)   ![](http://www.adendavies.com/uploads/2017/07/Slide16-768x432.png) These functions form around 90% of day to day banking functions for most people If new regulated companies have access to these services they can be pseudo or neo banks and that means we should see some real innovation in the space which has been sorely lacking.
