# Week 24/03/2019 - Week 29

A glimmer of hope at the end of a massive project tunnel can just be spotted. It is a fragile light and I don't wish to jinx it but the big infrastructure change we are working on is so close to getting released. God I will be so glad to get it over the line so we can build upon the great changes it brings. 

This week I got a great reminder of the value of people able to bring order to chaos, to cut through noise, bring understanding and get everyone to a common goal and clear outcome. Two great examples of that this week from two people who made my life easier in a couple of very tough meetings. These are also skills I need to work on, especially anything to do with data. 

I went to see a card supplier this week which was properly fascinating as I finally got to see how debit cards are madeâ€¦well the personalisation bits of the production as the blanks that are embossed and encoded are actually produced elsewhere. Still a fascinating factory process with a good mix of automation and manual effort. 

Back to running after a week off. Felt pretty good but I skipped a long run on Saturday morning in favour of a few beers on Friday with people after work. So little willpower. 

My kids behaved well on a morning before a school run this week and the effect on my stress levels before starting the day was remarkable. More of that please children. 

On Saturday a day out in Buxton with a few friends. Went to see Buxton FC vs Scarborough then a few beers round the town. [Buxton Brewery and their Tap House bars](https://www.buxtonbrewery.co.uk/tap-house) are fantastic. Another local brewery have a newish pub that is an old converted bank branch called [Redwillow](https://www.redwillowbrewery.com/buxton). Great beer and pork scratchings. We also managed to play pool after midnight and then went to a restaurant that had transformed into an impromptu drum and bass night. Good day out. 

I liked this post on [different types of weeknotes](https://samvillis.com/2018/10/12/weeknote-styles/). Might give one of these a try next week.
