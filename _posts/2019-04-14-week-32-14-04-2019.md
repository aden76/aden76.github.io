# Week 32 - 14/04/19

Some stuff happened at work. Some good. Some not so good.

I enjoyed Mike Bracken's post on [digital transformation](https://medium.com/iipp-blog/digital-transformation-is-a-leadership-problem-8c0c97f829ca). 

Today I ran the [Sheffield Half Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/2288892172) and it was ridiculously difficult again. Got a personal best but it felt like a failure as the last 8k were so slow. Managed 2 hours and 20 mins. Was hoping for at least 5 minutes quicker. Let's try again next year. 

I am very tired and I can't type anymore.
