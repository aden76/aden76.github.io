# Sneakers - Futuristic Film Money

[Sneakers (1992)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/) Robert Redford and his team break into banks using some lovely old interfaces both digital and analogue. I bet that today there are still interfaces like this in most banks too. This clip shows the code breaker box in action as they get into the encrypted Federal Reserve. This is just the beginning, Ben Kingsley wants to bring them all down.
