# Week 37 - 19/05/19

As expected I forgot to record how much work I did on non-customer related things. But looking back from a Sunday night it was not very much. Maybe next week. 

Something that will help is getting teams set up to build to outcomes rather than Project Tetris. Our change to this way of working rumbles on and this week should see us get the new teams together. I think small empowered teams are the only way to make useful things. This tweet from Tom Loosemore resonated

We had our annual game of FA Cup day football to celebrate a few friends birthdays. A 4-2 loss for the SWFC team. Frustrating and tiring. Too old and unfit for football. The eating and drinking after was good though.
